To set this up you need to do following:
1. You have to create row and give it data-title `question` form # icon on row settings.
2. Inside row add a button for each option.
3. and then add a dropdown "Select Box" Element. Give Input Name the Question and add all options inisde it.
4. Then copy code from `survey-cf.js` to "Settings > Tracking Code > Footer Code.
7. Save the Page and you are done.
